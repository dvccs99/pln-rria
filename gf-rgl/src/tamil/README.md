## Implementation information

### 13th August 2022

A conjugation table for verbs and an inference table for nouns have been implemented. A basic DetCN function taking a determiner and a common noun to combine to a noun phrase has also been implemented, with one determiner ("this_Quant") and one noun ("house_N") in use. Use the command "gr -cat=NP" to generate the tree.
